# Code documentation

As I want to allow the user to use the library in their projects, I want to provide an overview of the more important classes and functions. This will allow the user to understand how the library works and how they can use it in their projects.

The UI's code is intentionally left out, as it is only a light wrapper around the library. The UI is not meant to be used in other projects, so it is not documented here.

## Issues and contributions

If you find any inconsistencies or errors in the documentation, please let me know by opening an issue on the [github page](https://github.com/lichterberci/bloch-sphere-simulator/issues)

If you want to directly contribute to the project, you can fork the repository and create a pull request. I will review the pull request and merge it if it is appropriate.

## PyPi

Currently the library is not on PyPi but I plan to add it in the future. This will allow you to install the library using `pip` with an online repository.
